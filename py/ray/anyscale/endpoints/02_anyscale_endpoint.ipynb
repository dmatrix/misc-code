The function is defined recursively, with the base case being `n == 0` or `n == 1`, where the Fibonacci number is simply 0 or 1, respectively. For larger values of `n`, the function calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of the two resulting Fibonacci numbers.\n",

The function first checks if the result for `n` is already stored in the dictionary, and if so, returns it. Otherwise, it computes the result using the recursive formula and stores it in the dictionary before returning it. This memoized version of the function is more efficient for large values of `n`, as it avoids redundant computations.\n",
