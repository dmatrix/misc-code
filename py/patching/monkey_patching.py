"""
A monkey patch is a way for a program to extend or modify supporting
system software locally (affecting only the running instance of
the program). â€” Wikipedia

As a dynamic language, Python allows us to use monkey patching in
our coding by extending specific modules or classes without modifying
their original implementations. That is one can replace or inject
dynamically new code in place of the original code.
